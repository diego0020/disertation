The ideas reflected in the previous chapters were implemented into a software platform called Braviz. This software is licensed under a LGPL license and its source code and documentation can be found online at http://diego0020.github.io/braviz . As suggested by user centered design, the software was the result of several iterations. The architecture of the software reflects the model described in chapter \ref{chap_model}. Details of these aspects will be given in the following. Finally we will describe some of the more technical details of the software.
