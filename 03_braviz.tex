The ideas reflected in the previous chapters were implemented into a software platform called Braviz. This software is licensed under a LGPL license and its source code and documentation can be found online at http://diego0020.github.io/braviz . As suggested by user centered design, the software was the result of several iterations. The architecture of the software reflects the model described in chapter \ref{chap_model}. Details of these aspects will be given in the following. Finally we will describe some of the more technical details of the software.

\section{Iterations}

The development of the platform went trough several prototypes that were tested with target users. From each prototype several lessons were learned, both from the technical point and from the users feedback. Each iteration brings new ideas and challenges to the project. As the process goes on prototypes become more sophisticated. At the start changes occur very fast, while at the process goes on changes are smaller and take longer. The whole process can be seen as a spiral (see figure \ref{intro_spiral}). This section will provide an overview of each of the iterations up to the current point, and show the more significant insights and changes from each of them. Notice that the process has not stopped, and we expect the platform to continue evolving. Chapter \ref{chap_conclusions} will provide details of the plans for future iterations.

\subsection{Previous Work}

The first prototype built by our group was called KAB \autocite{castro_kab:_2012}. This tool was built to analyze data from the KMC pilot study \autocite{schneider_cerebral_2012}. This software integrated data from Diffusion MRI, Functional MRI and structural MRI. The main interface of the tool is shown in figure \ref{}
