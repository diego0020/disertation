One of the challenges in brain research is finding relationships between the physical structure of the brain and the way it functions. Structural information is gathered mainly through the use of imaging techniques as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computer Aided Tomography (CAT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Other methods measure the electrical activity of the brain, as in Electro-Encephalography  (EEG) or Magneto-Encephalography (MEG). Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a technique where cells are stimulated using a rapid changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an electrical field inside the neurons, the effects of this stimulation are afterwards measured elsewhere. 

Traditionally research is done by formulating hypotheses and designing experiments to test such hypotheses. Next, recruiting subjects, performing the experiment on each of them and gathering data. Finally this data would be analyzes using statistical methods which provide evidence in favor or against the hypothesis. This methodology imposes limitations on how data is used. Usually data is only used once, which is a shame because gathering this data is expensive in time, effort and resources. 

In the past years there has been a shift towards gathering data in a more open fashion, and several public databases have appeared. There has been several improvements in the way data is collected, stored and shared, both at the technical level and at the policies level. Even inside small research groups, it has become usual to keep looking at the data after traditional hypothesis testing is complete. 

All of this is leading to a change in the way research is done. This is a shift from hypothesis driven research into data driven research. This also creates an increased need for exploratory analysis methods, where the ecosystem is dominated by methods created for confirmatory analysis. In this context new challenges appear. It is now necessary to manage, analyze and visualize data where the number of subjects is increased by orders of magnitude, as well as the measures available for each one. In this scenario it is hard to guarantee homogeneity on the data belonging to each subject. In several cases there are measures available for each subject at several points in time.
