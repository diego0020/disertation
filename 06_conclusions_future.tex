Explicit contributions to experts (neuroscience, images, research)
- Cleaner datasets
- Deeper analysis
- Subject as a whole
- Extract more information from each data-set
- Share work across experts
- Better understanding through visualizations
- Ask new questions
- Freely explore, follow curiosity, leave room for surprises


Answer research questions, close the gap, close the introduction


How the model helps
