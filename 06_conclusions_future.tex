%Answer research questions, close the gap, close the introduction
The previous chapters presented a model that allows to design and implement software tools that support exploratory analysis of data from large brain studies with heterogeneous data from multiple subjects. This model was used to implement a set of applications that supported the analysis of data from a large brain study which included several types of data derived from neuro-images as well as clinical, demographic and socio-economic data. Further tests with potential users showed the relevance of this type of tools in today's research. Tools like the ones proposed in this work can change the way in which information is extracted from data and help in the transition towards a more collaborative and open research. 

\section{Effects in research workflow}

%- Explicit contributions to experts (neuroscience, images, research)

%- Subject as a whole
%-- -integrate data
%- Deeper analysis
%-- Ask new questions
%-- complex questions
%- Better understanding through visualizations
%- Extract more information from each data-set

%- Cleaner datasets
%- Time efficiency
% -- Do you spend more time looking at data now?

%- Encourage exploratory Analysis
%- Share work across experts
%-- more communication
%- Freely explore, follow curiosity, leave room for surprises

%- based on the case studies and evidence

\section{Importance of the model}


%
%How the model helps
%- Support exploratory research workflow
%- Improving data sharing
%- Faster coherent implementation, better maintainability
%- More efficient use of developers and experts time
%- Solve/maintain common problems only once 
%- Adapt to different users / projects / scenarios
%- Improving collaboration
%- Understanding of the design space
%- Thinking of possible solutions
%- Development time, time to market
%- 

%- Based on Braviz
