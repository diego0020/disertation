The Kangaroo foundation has contributed significantly to the development of this project. The experts that work with the foundation have provided us information on their research methodologies. They also provided us two very interesting data-sets and were willing to test all our prototypes. In return we helped them analyze and make sense of these complex data-sets. This collaboration enriched the project and allowed the experts in the foundation to extract information from the data efficiently. This chapter will illustrate the benefits of this collaboration and show how the Braviz platform can provide value in a real study.
