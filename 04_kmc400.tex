The Kangaroo foundation contributed significantly to the development of this project. Their research methodologies and data-sets on preterm children were the basis for the development of BRAVIZ, which they tested and used. In return the IMAGINE team helped in managing and processing image data, and its integration with clinical data. This chapter provides details of this collaboration and shows how the BRAVIZ platform provides value in a real study. The full methodology and results from the kangaroo mother care studies are found in \autocite{schneider_cerebral_2012} and \autocite{charpak_final_2015}.

\section{Kangaroo Mother Care}

%cual es el problema?
Low birth weight (LBW) is a mayor cause of child mortality \autocite{wardlaw_low_2005}, and on those who survive it can produce long term sequels and impairments \autocite{nosarti_neurodevelopmental_2010}. 

Kangaroo mother care (KMC) was developed by Edgar Rey in 1978 \autocite{rey_rational_1983} as an alternative to the conventional care method for infants born with low weight \autocite{conde-agudelo_kangaroo_2003}. It was initially conceived to deal with the lack of incubators and high rate of infections. The treatment is made up of three components.

The first one is kangaroo position, where the child is placed on the mother's or father's (or someone else's) chest, skin to skin, in an upright vertical position as shown in Figure \ref{fig_kmc_position}. This keeps the baby warm, and provides positive stimulation to the babie's brain through all senses. In kangaroo position the baby hears the mother's voice and her heart beat, senses her smell, feels her skin ans sees her face and her environment \autocite{tessier_kangaroo_2003}. In addition, the mother receives the stimulation she needs to increase milk production \autocite{charpak_kangaroo_2005}. This positions is maintained until the baby doesn't tolerate it any more, which indicates that appropriate temperature regulation has been achieved. 

The second component is breastmilk nutrition every two hours. The goal is to obtain a weight gain rate similar to what it would be in uterus. If the baby's growth is shown to be adequate the feeding schedule can be relaxed. In case the target weight gain can't be accomplished with breastmilk alone, a formula supplement may be added. This supplement should be administered via dropper or spoon so that it does not interfere with breastfeeding reflexes.

The final component is an early discharge from the hospital, with proper followup. This has the benefit of keeping the child away from infections, as well as providing an environment where strong bonds between the child and his family are more likely to form \autocite{charpak_kangaroo_2005}.

\end{figure}

KMC has gone a long way since its invention \autocite{charpak_kmc_2011} and several refinements have been developed. For instance, the kangaroo position is now started as soon as the baby is born whenever its possible. Extensive research has been conducted on the method which has provided a better understanding of its benefits \autocite{the_cochrane_collaboration_kangaroo_2014}, and it  has been adopted by the world health organization as a major strategy to decrease neonatal mortality in low birth weight infants. The kangaroo foundation is present in 30 countries with 60 teams.

\section{Randomized Control Trial}
%- The first randomized trial

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted between 1993 and 1996 to compare short and middle term outcomes of KMC in comparison to traditional treatment. The sample consisted of 746 infants born with low weight (less than 2000g.) at \emph{Clinica San Pedro Claver} in Bogotá. Eligible infants were randomly assigned to either KMC or traditional incubator treatment. KMC group remained on kangaroo position 24 hours a day and nurtured by breast feeding and an optional supplement (preterm infant formula) delivered by spoon or dropper, in order to guarantee a weight gain of 15 grams per kilogram per day until the reach of term. Children in the traditional group were kept in an incubator until they were able to control their temperature and were gaining weight at an acceptable rate, and discharged according to standard hospital practice. Both groups were followed until one year of corrected age. 

%-- What were the main findings
During this year there were fewer deaths in the KMC group as well as fewer visits to the hospital caused by infections. In addition, tests showed that mothers from the KMC group felt more competent with their babies. Griffiths and INFANIB tests showed higher cognitive development in the KMC group and this effect was more prominent on those born before 32 weeks of gestational age and those who went through ICU. There was also a high impact of KMC on the development of personal relations and on planning functions related to brain development \autocite{tessier_kangaroo_2003}. Details of this study and its findings can be found in \autocite{charpak_current_1996,charpak_kangaroo_1997,charpak_randomized_2001,charpak_kangaroo_2005}.

\section{Pilot Study}

In 2009, thirty-nine children who were part of the original study were relocated. This sample was composed of children born at or before 33 weeks of gestational age, 21 belonged to the KMC group and 18 to the control group. In addition, 9 kids born at term at the same hospitaland with similar socio-economic background were recruited. 
The first step was performing full sight and hearing examinations and, in case of need, prescribing and manufacturing glasses or hearing aids. Then one month was given in order to let the children adapt to new glasses or hearing aids. 

Then they went through several neuropsychological tests including Wisc, VMI, and CBCL. 
Next a TMS experiment was performed where double pulse TMS was used to test intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and a single pulse was used to test interhemispheric inhibition. All measures were taken at the first interosseous, and both hemispheres were tested.
Finally magnetic resonance images (MRI) were acquired at \emph{Fundación Santa Fé de Bogotá} using a GE Sigma HD scanner of 1.5 Tesla. The protocol included structural T1 and T2 weighted images , DWI and six functional paradigms.

Functional images were processed with FSL and DWI images were processed using MEDINRIA \autocite{toussaint_medinria:_2007}. Additionally several anatomical regions were segmented and measured manually. The KAB software platform described in section \ref{sec_kab} was developed to perform additional analyses on this dataset. This tool was appreciated by researchers as it provided a link between quantitative data and the spatial data from which it is derived. It also created an environment in which it was possible to think visually of the relationships between TMS, white matter structure and functional MRI. This dataset was also used for testing and validating the first versions of Braviz (see section \ref{sec_iterations}).

The TMS study in this pilot showed an important difference in kids that belonged to the incubator group compared to those in KMC and term \autocite{schneider_cerebral_2012} in inter-hemispheric inhibition. The latency of this inhibition also showed some interesting effects in the interaction between gender, hemisphere and group. This results indicate that KMC encourages brain plasticity and therefore reduce the negative effects of a preterm birth.

%The saving brains project

Between 2013 and 2014, financed by Canada Grand Challenges, the kangaroo foundation started a project that involved relocating and recruiting 50\% of the subjects from the RCT that survived after the first year (between 340 and 430 subjects). Measures were taken in order to avoid selection bias in this sub-sample, specifically, comparing the distributions of relevant demo-graphical and clinical variables between the retrieved and not retrieved groups, as well as comparing them between the two groups (KMC and control) in the retrieved population. In case a selection bias was detected sensibility analyzes would be conducted on any results in order to mitigate the effects. 

Given budget restrictions it was not possible to perform magnetic resonance scans on the whole sample. However the initial RCT was stratified by birth weight, which allowed to make unbiased comparisons on each stratum. Therefore, it was decided to do imaging only on those participants which were born with less that 1800 g. 

By this time participants were between 18 and 20 years old. The study aimed at identifying if the KMC intervention had a long term effect protecting the brain against cognitive, social, and academic difficulties. Specifically, by analyzing data about brain maturation and structure, mental functions and behavioral patterns exhibited in family, school and work. 

Because there were no reference values for young adults available for some of the neuro-psychological and functional imaging paradigms that were to be acquired, a complementary sample of fifty subjects born at term on the same clinic where the RCT was performed was also retrieved. This sample was part of an observational study that occurred one year after the KMC RCT and i was meant only to provide reference values and not for direct comparisons with the other groups.

Relocating the subjects started by using the contact information from the original RCT; followed by searches in government databases and social networks, public media advertising and visits to the last known residency where information was sought from current inhabitants and neighbors. This labor was conducted by the social workers in the foundation, at the end managed to relocate 491 subjects, from which 441 could and were willing to participate in the new study. 


%phases of the study
\subsection{Data Acquisition Procedure}
 
As in the pilot study, the first stop for each participant is a vision and hearing examination, following by the prescription and acquisition of glasses or hearing aids if needed. After one month or habituation, data would be collected on tree different days.

The first day comprised a full medical evaluation where the medical history was collected and physical and neurological exams were performed by a pediatrician. During the exam, quality of life (Kidscreen-52) and Life habits surveys were administered. Subsequently a battery of neuro-psychological tests were administered by a psychologist. 

On a second visit the TMS experiment was conducted, and magnetic resonance images were acquired for subjects born with less 1800 g. of weight. 

Finally, the social worker and an economist visited the residency, place of work and school of the participant. In this visit an evaluation of the dwelling place was conducted, and questionnaires were applied to parents and best friend. If the subject was at school a class play test was performed in the classroom. Finally the economist retrieved information about the education and work history of the participant, and collected the necessary information and authorization to retrieve the results of the national high school test (saber-11).

In addition, data captured during the first year follow up were retrieved from the database. These included

\begin{itemize}
\item Social characteristics of parents
\item Pregnancy characteristics 
\item Type of birth
\item Weight, size and cranial perimeter at birth and during follow up
\item Hospitalization at birth and during follow up
\item Questionnaire of mother competence
\end{itemize}

Data was captured in paper and online using standarized forms. and then entered into an Microsoft Access Database specifically implemented for the project. Data cleaning and quality control processes were performed regularly during data acquisition. These included double data entry for selected variables and manual comparison of database values and raw data. Periodic exploratory analyzes were also conducted while data was being acquired. These allowed to quickly detect outliers and missing values, which could be caused by problems on data input. For this process SPSS was used together with BRAVIZ. The visualizations provided by the software and the capability of identifying individual points on plots provided an efficient way of detecting strange values.

Data acquisition for this project took about two years. After it was completed analysis of the data began. The first task was comparing demographic and biological variables from early life in the effectively retrieved sample with the full RCT sample in order to detect possible sampling bias. No problems were found at this stage. Afterwards \emph{crude} (unadjusted) comparisons were made for all metrics between the KMC and control groups. Then there was an analysis of possible confounders and effect modifiers (mediators and modulators); followed by the corrected comparisons between the two groups. 

Next, additional exploratory analyzis began. It is at this stage where BRAVIZ could make the most difference, especially when spatial data is to be considered. This process is not finished yet, and possibly there is much this data sets could tell. The following sections will take a closer look at the different dimensions of the study.

\subsection{Neuro-psychology and Environment}

In order to assess mental functions and behavior of subjects several neuropsychological tests were applied to participants. The majority were self-reports but some were filled by parents, best friends and classmates. The applied tests are listed below, full details are available at \autocite{uriza_reporte_2015}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cognitive

		\item CVLT: Episodic memory
	\end{itemize}
	\item Life Quality

		\item ASR: Adult Self Report
		\item Rosemberg: Self-esteem questionnaire
	\end{itemize}
	\item Neurosensorial 
	\begin{itemize}

		\item Nine Holes Peg Test: Manual dexterity
		\item Beery Visuo-Motor Integration: Assesses integration between visual and motor abilities by copying images from a booklet.

	\end{itemize}
	\item Environment
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Home: Family environment
		\item RCP: Revised Class Play, schoolmate relationship
		\item Evaluation of dwelling space
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The preliminary analysis of the data does not show any direct relationship of the treatment to any of the cognitive measures at adulthood. However it does show that during the first year there is a direct impact on the development quotient (DQ) measured by the Griffith. The hypothesis is that KMC creates positive changes in the family which have a direct implication on the DQ. At twenty years the IQ is highly related to the DQ at childhood and  environment variables (HOME), which are partially affected by the KMC intervention, as well as behavior and mental health variables. The working hypothesis is that KMC improves the familiar and home environment for the kid, which in turn creates a better environment for him to grow and develop, leading in the long term to a better performance in school and society.

\subsection{Economics}

The Research Group in Economics from Universidad del Rosario got involved in the project in order to analyze the education and labor history of the cohort, with the main question being if the KMC intervention affected these outcomes. For this purpose they created a questionnaire, based on validated questions from previous studies and the National Department of Statistics (DANE). This questionnaire was applied to each participant at the end of the domiciliary visit. The instrument also inquired about the schools to which the participant attended, the performance at those schools, and if currently the participant was studying or working, what kind of studies were they pursuing and what kind of work were they performing. Note that this study was approved by an ethics committee, where data protection measures were considered. The questionnaires were tabulated by a professional at the foundation and verified by the Economics group. Finally the results were merged with other variables of the study.

Additionally, participants gave their authorization to fetch the results of the last state high-school test (Saber-11) they completed. This test is applied to all students of the country when they are about to finish high-school, and it comprises sections on mathematics, language, social studies, philosophy,  natural sciences and English.

Analysis began by taking a broad look of the effect of the intervention on key variables, as the current wage and performance in Saber-11 using linear regression in the Stata software. At the next stage, the analysis was performed using additional variables as controls, chosen based on economics theory and previous experience of main researchers. This showed some interesting aspects in the results, which were discussed with the rest of the Kangaroo team. From this discussion, ideas of possible explanations and additional variables that should be taken into effect emerged. Ongoing work is analyzing specific subgroups inside the sample. 

Early results show that apparently KMC affects the way in which parents make choices, leading to KMC parents being more disposed to increase the number of years that children attend preschool. As many of the participants have not yet entered the workforce, results about wages can't be conclusive. Nevertheless an analysis restricted to those already earning a salary shows that KMC subjects have higher hourly wages. Additional analysis are still required to better understand the economical and educational outcome of this sample.  The complete discussion of the methodology and results from the Economics team will be published soon.

It is important that the analysis was carried out mainly through tables generated by Stata. Generating graphics in this software required additional steps, and therefore was only done to present the results. However when inquired about the possible benefits of using more graphics during the analyzes they expressed that they are used to reading tables and are very efficient at it, and usually, the amount of variables used in economics is limited and standardized. Nevertheless they appreciated BRAVIZ because it gave them access to spatial data, in which they didn't had any previous experience. They also recognized that interdisciplinary studies have much more variables than what they are used to, and therefore visual analysis will be very valuable for them in the future.


\subsection{Transcraneal Magnetic Stimulation}

%TMS details
TMS examination was carried out using two Magstim 200 stimulators coordinated by the Magstim Bistim. Subjects were comfortably sited in a chair with the arm in a pillow. An electrode connected to a EMG was connected to the first dorsal interosseus muscle. The TMS coil was located on top of the motor area of the opposed hemisphere. Optimal location for the coil was determined by the operator by searching the location that would induce a higher response on the EMG. For this procedure the stimulator was configured at 80\% of maximum output, if the hotspot could not be found at this level output power would be raised. The next step was estimating the motor threshold, this is, the minimum output power required in order to induce a response in the muscle on half the attempts. A test was next performed at 120\% of the threshold, this output would be used as baseline.

%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Rest motor threshold
%		\item MEP (Motor Evoked Potential) Latency
%		\item Intra-cortical inhibition
%		\item Intra-cortical facilitation
%		\item Inter-hemispheric inhibition
%	\end{itemize}

Intracortical inhibition was tested by applying two pulses, the first one at 80\% of the threshold and the second one at 120\% of the threshold, separated by 3ms. For testing intracortical facilitation two pulses, at 80\% and 120\%, were used, but in this case separated by 15ms. These tests were repeated 10 times each, and performed on both hemispheres.

For testing interhemispheric inhibition the subject was asked to apply pressure with the thumb, first at maximum strength, and then maintaining it at 50\% of the maximum level. Afterwards a single pulse, at 200\% of the motor threshold , would be applied on the same side as the target muscle, this pulse would generate a response on the opposite side but also would cause an inhibition in the active muscle. 

%TMS processing
The signal captured by the EEG machine includes an artifact generated by the TMS pulse. An example signal can be seen in figure \ref{fig_tms_signal}. This signals are analyzed with the help of matlab scripts in other to determine the latency between the artifact and the motor evoked potential (MEP) or the inhibition; as well as the amplitude of the MEP in both cases, and duration of inhibition. Calculate the different in MEP amplitude between the baseline and intracortical inhibition or facilitation trials is a key measure. The time it takes for the signal to arrive from the motor cortex to the muscle is related to the distance it has to travel, therefore it is common to correct latency values with subject height. All these measures were calculated, averaged across all the trials, and added to the main study database.

MRI image acquisition was done at the San Ignacio University Hospital using a Phillips Achieva 3 Tesla scanner with a eight channels head  antenna. A sequence resembling MPRAGE was captured in order to provide Freesurfer the most appropriate contrast for automatic segmentation. Additionally a volumetric T1 image and a Flair sequence and a T2 image were captured to provide additional anatomical context. A high quality diffusion weighted sequence was also captured as one of the main goals of the study was analyzing white matter structure. Tables \ref{tab_mri_params} and \ref{tab_fmri_params} show the detailed acquisition parameters used for each sequence.

Five f-MRI paradigms were used in this study: Attention, coordination, memory, grip and fear. These paradigms were selected because previous studies  showed that preterm kids have motor, attention, memory and emotion management alterations \autocite{nosarti_neurodevelopmental_2010}. Because each participant could only remain inside the scanner for a limited time, not all paradigms could be applied to all subjects. Two groups were created, the first one went through grip, coordination, attention and memory; while the second one through grip, coordination and fear. 

The grip paradigm had a block design where subjects were asked to apply pressure with thumb on the side of the index finger, and in this way activating the first dorsal interosseus muscle, the muscle targeted in the TMS test. The coordination paradigm also had a block design but this time the task was opening and closing one or both hands following the pictures presented on the screen. The attention paradigm used a block design as well. In this case the subject would be presented with seven points on the screen, and they were instructed to follow the tree red points. Next all points would become black and start moving around the screen. At the end the initial points would become red again and the participant would be asked if they arrived to the same final position. 

The memory paradigm was composed of two stages, both in block designs. During the first stage participants were shown couples of words and asked to memorize them. During the second stage participants were presented with a word they have seen before, and two options for the second word. They were asked to identify which word was seen before together with the first word.


The fear conditioning paradigm was event related and divided in two stages. In the first stage participants were randomly presented with two woman faces. Half of the time one of the faces was shown was accompanied by a loud horror scream.  During the second stage  both faces were shown again randomly, but this time there would not be any scream. After the presentation of each face at both stages participants would have to respond using a qualitative scale how anxious they were feeling.

% Data analysis
\subsubsection{Spatial Data Analysis}

Image data was pre-processed as described in section \ref{sec_preproc}. Anatomical images went through a VBM analysis in SPM comparing the two groups from the randomized study, using age and gender as control variables and \emph{Eigenvariants} for each subject in each region of interest were extracted and added to the database of variables. MPRAGE images went through the FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline and all output statistics (volumes, cortical thickness, surface areas, and cortex curvature) were as well added to the database. 

At this points all of the spatial artifacts  generated by freesurfer (segmentations, transforms and cortex reconstructions) were also available in BRAVIZ, and therefore it was direct to use python scientific libraries to perform additional analyzes. Script that went through all segmented structures, and for each one calculated the main, second and third axes, as shown in figure \ref{fig_jth_descs} were run. The lengths of these axes were added to the database as new variables.

\end{figure}

DWI data was processed using Camino and the Free Surfer brain masks as references. Transformations between diffusion space and structural MRI space were calculated using \emph{FSL FLIRT}. From Camino, FA, MD and color DTI maps, were obtained together wit full brain tractography. All of these were integrated into BRAVIZ and made available for the experts. Using BRAVIZ based scripts, Free Surfer data was combined with tractography in order to isolate bundles going through particular structures. Mean FA, mean MD, mean length and number of tracks in these bundle were extracted.  While this could be achieved without BRAVIZ, it was certainly easier using the infrastructure provided by the software. Additionally BRAVIZ was used to let experts define spherical regions of interests and, based on them, define additional bundles of interest. The same scalar metrics mentioned before were extracted for these bundles. 

Free Surfer's Tracula pipeline was also ran on DWI images. Output statistics were exported into the database and the probability maps of the bundles were integrated into BRAVIZ for visualization. 

Functional MRI data was pre-processed in SPM.  After that a first level analysis was performed using specific contrasts for each paradigm, followed by a second level analysis using the main groups as regressor. The results from this analysis can be seen in \autocite{uriza_reporte_2015}. The BRAVIZ \emph{fMRI Explore} tool was particularly useful in the first level stage as it displayed contrasts in a direct and clear way. Figure \ref{fig_spm_contrast_error} shows a problem with a contrast, because the left and right conditions are not of the same length. This problem was quickly identified and corrected.

\subsection{Future Work}

The analysis of the data collected in this project is still far from finished. The crude analysis described above, which is simply regressing on each outcome variable against the exposition variable, is not enough. Reality is much complex and several factors must be taken into account to perform a meaningful analysis. It requires defining the sample carefully and choosing a meaningful set of confounders. Also it is interesting to look at relationships that don't include the exposure variables, in order to get a better understanding of the factors that affect the development of preterm kids. 

For the moment only basic analysis have been done on spatial data. The information that can be extracted using scalars is limited, and probably more interesting hypotheses can be discovered by making use of the totality of the data. However this will require advanced tools and methodologies. Several second level analyzes should be performed using the SPM framework, as well as TBSS analyzes and shape analysis. This will have to be complemented with visual analyses performed by domain experts and new visualization options that can work at this scale. It would also be interesting to analyze the raw data captured during the TMS experiments (EMG signals) in order to find additional patterns to the ones found using the derived scalars. 

Another challenge is looking at the behavior of the cohort through time. This is, analyzing the stability or variability of the different dimensions at the different epochs in which data is available, and looking at the factors which determine this changes.

All data collected during this study will be made available on request to interested researchers from around the world, with the objective of improving the understanding of the different factors that affected development of this cohort. This data must be used for hypotheses generation through exploratory analyzes, while confirming those hypotheses will likely require gathering additional data.

\subsubsection{Quality Control}

Gathering data and collecting it in a database in a project of this magnitude is large and complex task. Several steps are required and on each of them several things can go wrong. Data has to be continuously checked, validated and corrected as the project moves forward. This labor can benefit from automatic tools that check for values that are outside of range, are missing or which don't add up with other values. However large amounts of manual inspecting is also required. 

Anomalies in the data are much easier to detect when data is presented in graphical form than when presented in a table. A famous example of this is the Anscombe's Quartet \autocite{anscombe_graphs_1973}. BRAVIZ can be used to visually explore data even as it is been acquired. Visualizations can be created and re visited again when more data is available. By looking at plots from the data strange values immediately grab researcher's attention. This values can be instantaneously identified and verified from the raw data. Results from all analyzes are always accompanied by plots, which provides another sanity check. Any bizarre values will become evident and therefore the danger of believing results based on pathological data is drastically reduced.

Verifying image data is also simple using tools from Braviz. The setup used the most was several \emph{Subject Viewer} applications showing different critical slices of the image. An expert in radiology could then cycle through the subjects using the keyboard, and asses their quality. By using the platform it was possible to go over two hundred subjects in an hour. Images that appeared strange at first sight would be further evaluated by navigating in the 3d Viewer. Likewise quality of the registration between the different modalities could be checked by for example displaying the corpus callosum segmentation on top of an FA image or using the dedicated \emph{Check registration} application.

\subsubsection{Fiber Bundles Creation}

As the project advanced, questions related to different pathways in the brain started to emerge. In order to answer these questions it was necessary to isolate in the tractography specific fiber bundles. Some of these could be defined using structures segmented by FreeSurfer, and therefore easily extracted for all subjects. However some of them required more precise location of regions of interest. 

The \emph{Roi Builder} application was created to streamline the placement of ROIs for each subject. An expert can specify the precise location for a region of interest in a single subject, using diffusion, structural and functional images, and results from segmentation as a basis. By having all images together in the same space, the correct location for the ROI can be better determined. Figure \ref{fig_thalamus_seed} shows how the lateral thalamic region can be seeded using three different image modalities.  This application also permits using additional region of interests to better isolate an specific group of fibers. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig_thalamus_fibers} where the bundles from the lateral thalamus to the medial cerebral peduncle are isolated by using two different spherical ROIs.

Figure \ref{fig_fronto_occipital} shows how the fronto occipital tract can be isolated using two spherical ROIs. This tract is a long association way  important for visual memory. Two different subjects are shown, with different number of fibers on this tract. Both of them were born at 28 weeks of gestation and with weights close to 950 grams; however the one with the less dense tracts suffers from a neuro-sensorial alteration.

The superior longitudinal fasciculus can be isolated by placing a single ROI in the coronal plane. Figure \ref{fig_long_fasc} shows the result of this operation and a comparison to the equivalent bundle identified by Tracula.

\end{figure} 

After positioning the spherical region on one subject, the application can approximate the equivalent location for the rest of the sample by using the available linear and non linear registration transforms. These locations would then be revised and adjusted by the expert, but the interface was built to make this process as efficient as possible. All actions can be completed using hot-keys, including changing subjects, therefore the user interactions are limited to moving the mouse around a small area and hitting keys on the keyboard.

ROIs can also be used to measure FA, MD, T-score from a functional paradigm or any the value of any other image inside it. This was used in the study to measure diffusion characteristics at several points of interest, which are known to be at risk in preterm babies. These points were

\begin{itemize}
\item Optic Chiasm
\item Optic tract back of the chiasm at both sides
\item Corona radiata
\item Left and right tapetum
\item Left and right lateral geniculate nuclei
\item Posterior Thalamus
\end{itemize}

These values were used in statistical analyses throughout the study, both inside Braviz itself, and exported to the main SPSS database.

The \emph{Logic Bundles} application can be used to define bundles using segmented structures and ROIs as waypoints. Figure \ref{fig_papez} shows the fibers between the amygdala and the hippocampus, which is part of the Papez circuit.

\subsubsection{Data exploration}

One of the main purposes of Braviz was enabling researchers to quickly find potential relationships in the data that deserved a closer look. Displaying data visually lets the human visual system find odd aspects, which can lead experts to think of new possibilities. 

Figure \ref{fig_anova_example} shows the plot of an ANOVA analysis for the volume of the left caudate nucleus against the exposure variable and a fragility index. The plot shows that the most fragile subjects tend to have smaller caudate nuclei in both groups, but this relationship is not statisticially significant. Nevertheless it is worth taking a closer look and analyze if there is a biological justification for it. If this is the case, maybe it is worth collecting more data in order to test this new hypothesis. Figure \ref{fig_caudate_parallel} shows another view of this relationship, this time showing left and right caudate nuclei. From the plot it can be seen that for most subjects both nuclei tend to have the same volume, and these are negatively related to the fragility index. It also calls attention an outlier who has a strong asymmetry. Figure \ref{fig_asymetric_caudate_detail} shows this outlier on the \emph{Subject Overview} application; where it can be confirmed that the asymmetry is real. This can be seen directly on the image as well as on the notes written by the radiologist.

\subsubsection{Selected Subjects Cases}

The FLAIR image from one of the subjects present several circular regions with hypersignal which indicate ischemic lesions, this can be seen in Figure \ref{fig_white_matter_lessions_a}. These are typical in patients with sifilis, drug abuse or hypertension, and do not usually appear before birth. The clinical data does not show any drug related problems, but it does  that the subject had a hearing loss which went undetected for the first year of life, and did not improve with by hearing aids or implants. 
The Grifiths coefficient at 12 months had a value of 100 which is located in the middle of the sample, however the WASI coefficient at 20 years old has a value of 69, which is at the lower extreme of the sample (see Figure \ref{fig_white_matter_lessions_b}). This appears to confirm that the lesions occurred after birth.

One of the subjects presents a prominent dilation of the supratentorial ventricular system with thinning of the periventricular white matter indicated by FLAIR hypersignal. These findings suggest periventricular leukomalacia caused by lesions in vulnerable areas related to perinatal hypoxia or ischemia in preterms. This subject was indeed born at 31 weeks of gestational age with a weight of 1100 grams. By using a region of interest in the peri-ventricular parietal at the supramarginal gyrus on the right side, the tractography shows a clear alteration in the number and arrangement of fibers (see Figure \ref{fig_homunculus_feet}). There are some transversal, non anatomical fibers, that could indicate brain plasticity. The fibers belonging to the corticobulbar tract appear diminished. In the homuncular representation, these fibers are associated with the feet. At the left side, there are only a few long longitudinal fibers, with a severe diminution of the projection tracts associated with feet and hands. These findings correspond to the clinical diagnosis of the subject, who has spastic cerebral palsy, with right hemiparesis and cerebellar ataxia.

While looking at white matter volumes in the sample, one subject stood out for having a significant lower volume (see Figure \ref{fig_white_matter}). Images showed an increase  in the diploe by hyperostesis of reactive aspect, and an increase in the thickness of temporal muscles (See Figure \ref{fig_diploe}). The cortical atrophy is predominantly parietal and frontal, but the volume of hippocampi and ventricular system is conserved, which indicates a conservation of deep brain fibers. The structural characteristics predict that the subject will have slower thought processes. Clinical data confirms that she has low WASI coefficient of 43, and that she had significant problems completing the nine holes peg test. The clinical diagnosis was a severe psychomotor retardation.
