\label{chap_kmc400}

The Kangaroo foundation has contributed significantly to the development of this project. The experts that work with the foundation have provided us information on their research methodologies. They also provided us two very interesting data-sets and were willing to test all our prototypes. In return we helped them analyze and make sense of these complex data-sets. This collaboration enriched the project and allowed the experts in the foundation to extract information from the data efficiently. This chapter will illustrate the benefits of this collaboration and show how the Braviz platform can provide value in a real study. Notice that the full methodology and results from this study can be found elsewhere \autocite{KMC400}; in this chapter only some aspects are illustrated in order to provide the context in which the tools were used.

\section{Randomized Control Trial}
%- The first randomized trial

Between 1993 and 1996 a randomized controlled trial comparing short and middle term outcomes of KMC in comparison to traditional treatment was conducted. The sample consisted of 746 infants born with low weight (less than 2000g.) at \emph{Clinica San Pedro Claver} in Bogotá. Eligible infants were randomly assigned to either KMC or traditional incubator treatment. KMC group remained on kangaroo position 24 hours a day and nurtured by breast feeding and an optional supplement (preterm infant formula) delivered by spoon or dropper, in order to guarantee a weight gain of 15 grams per kilogram per day until the reach of term. Children in the traditional group were kept in an incubator until they were able to control their temperature and were gaining weight at an acceptable rate, and discharged according to standard hospital practice. Both groups were followed until one year of corrected age. 

%-- What were the main findings
During this year there were fewer deaths in the KMC group as well as fewer visits to the hospital caused by infections. In addition, competency tests showed that mothers from the KMC group felt more competent with their babies. Griffiths and INFANIB tests showed higher cognitive development in the KMC group. This effect was more prominent on those born before 32 weeks of gestational age and those who went trough ICU. There was also a high impact of KMC on the development of personal relations and on planning functions related to brain development \autocite{tessier_kangaroo_2003}. Details of this study and its findings can be found in \autocite{charpak_current_1996,charpak_kangaroo_1997,charpak_randomized_2001,charpak_kangaroo_2005}.

In 2009, thirty-nine children who were part of the original study were relocated. The sample was composed of children born at or before 33 weeks of gestational age, 21 belonged to the KMC group and 18 from the traditional group. In addition, 9 kids born at term at the same hospital were recruited. 
The first step was doing full sight and hearing exams and, in case of need, prescribing and manufacturing glasses or hearing aides. One month was given in order to let the children adapt to glasses. Afterwards they went trough several neuropsychological tests including Wisc\autocite{WISC}, VMI\autocite{VMI}, and CBLT\autocite{CBLT}. They also went to a TMS experiment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where structural T1 and T2 weighted images were captured together with DWI and six functional paradigms.

Functional images were processed with FSL and DWI images were processed using MEDINRIA. The KAB software platform described in section \ref{sec_kab} was developed to perform additional analysis on this data. This dataset was also used for testing and validating the first versions of Braviz.

The TMS study in this pilot showed an important difference in kids that belonged to the incubator group compared to those in KMC and term \autocite{schneider_cerebral_2012} in inter-hemispheric inhibition. The latency of this inhibition also showed some interesting effects in the interaction between gender, hemisphere and group. This results indicate that KMC encourages brain plasticity and therefore reduce the effects of a preterm birth.

%The saving brains project

Between 2013 and 2014, financed by Canada Grand Challenges, the kangaroo foundation started a project that involved relocating and recruiting 50\% of the subjects from the RCT that survived after the first year (between 340 and 430 subjects). Measures were planned in order to avoid selection bias in this sub-sample. Specifically, comparing the distributions of relevant demo-graphical and clinical variables between the retrieved and not retrieved groups, as well as comparing them between the two groups (KMC and control) in the retrieved population. In case a selection bias was detected sensibility analyzes would be conducted on any results in order to mitigate the effects. 

Given budget restrictions it was not possible to perform magnetic resonance scans on the whole sample. However the initial RCT was stratified by birth weight, which allowed to make unbiased comparisons on each stratum. Therefore, it was decided to do imaging only on those participants which were born with less that 1800 g. 

By this time participants were between 18 and 20 years old. The study aimed at identifying if the KMC intervention had a long term effect protecting the brain against cognitive, social, and academic difficulties. Specifically, by analyzing data about brain maturation and structure, mental functions and behavioral patterns exhibited in family, school and work. 

Because there were no reference values for young adults available for some of the neuro-psychological and functional imaging paradigms that were to be acquired a complementary sample of fifty subjects born at term on the same clinic where the RCT was performed was also retrieved. This sample was part of an observational study that occurred one year after the main RCT. This sample was meant only to provide reference values, not for direct comparisons with the other groups.

Relocating the subjects started by using the contact information from the original RCT; followed by searches in goverment databases and social networks, public media advertising and visits to the last known residency where information was sought from current inhabitants and neighbors. This labor was conducted by the social workers in the foundation, at the end managed to relocate 491 subjects, from which 441 could and were willing to participate in the new study. 


%phases of the study
 
As in the pilot study, the first stop for each participant is a vision and hearing examination, following by the prescription and acquisition of glasses or hearing aides if they were needed. After one month or habituation, data would be collected on tree different days.

The first day comprised a full medical evaluation where the medical history was collected and physical and neurological exams were performed by a pediatrician. During the exam quality of life (Kidscreen-52) and Life habits surveys were administered. Afterwards a battery of neuro-psychological tests were administered by a psychologist. Details of these tests will be given in a following section. 

On a second visit the TMS experiment was conducted, and magnetic resonance images were acquired for subjects born with less 1800 g. of weight. Details of TMS and MRI scan will be presented later.

Finally, the social worker and an economist visited the residency, place of work and school of the participant. In this visit an evaluation of the dwelling place was conducted, and questionnaires were applied to parents and best friend. If the subject was at school a class play test was performed in the classroom. Finally the economist retrieved information about the education and work history of the participant, and collected the necessary information and authorization to retrieve the results of the national high school test (saber-11).

In addition, data captured during the first year follow up were retrieved from the database. These include

\begin{itemize}
\item Social characteristics of parents
\item Pregnancy characteristics 
\item Type of birth
\item Weight, size and cranial perimeter at birth and during follow up
\item Hospitalization at birth and during follow up
\item Questionnaire of mother competence
\end{itemize}

Data was captured in paper and online using standarized forms. These data was then entered into an Microsoft Access Database specifically implemented for the project. Data cleaning and quality control processes were performed regularly during data acquisition. These included double data entry for selected variables and manual comparison of database values and raw data. Periodic exploratory analyzes were also conducted regularly while data was being acquired. These allowed to quickly detect outliers and missing values, which could be caused by problems on data input. For this process SPSS was used together with Braviz. The visualizations provided by the software and the capability of identifying individual points on plots provided an efficient way of detecting strange values.

Acquiring data for this project took about two years. After it was completed analysis of the data began. The first task was comparing demographic and biological variables from early life in the effectively retrieved sample with the full RCT sample in order to detect possible sampling bias. No problems were found at this stage. Afterwards \emph{crude} (unadjusted) comparisons were made for all metrics between the KMC and control groups. Finally there was an analysis of possible confounders and effect modifiers (mediators and modulators); followed by the corrected comparisons between the two groups. This process involves a large component of exploratory analysis, and it is here where Braviz can make a difference, specially when spatial data is to be considered. This process is not finished yet, and possibly there is much this data sets could tell us that we have not found yet. In the following sections we will take a closer look at the different aspects of the study.

\subsection{TMS}

%TMS details
TMS examination was carried out using two Magstim 200 stimulators coordinated by the Magstim Bistim. Subjects were comfortably sited in a chair with the arm in a pillow. An electrode connected to a EMG was connected to the first dorsal interosseus muscle. The TMS coil was located on top of the motor area of the opposed hemisphere. Optimal location for the coil was determined by the operator by searching the location that would induce a higher response on the EMG. For this procedure the stimulator was configured at 80\% of maximum output, if the hotspot could not be found at this level output power would be raised. The next step was estimating the motor threshold, this is, the minimum output power required in order to induce a response in the muscle on half the attempts. A test was next performed at 120\% of the threshold, this output would be used as baseline for the next steps.

%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Rest motor threshold
%		\item MEP (Motor Evoked Potential) Latency
%		\item Intra-cortical inhibition
%		\item Intra-cortical facilitation
%		\item Inter-hemispheric inhibition
%	\end{itemize}

Intracortical inhibition was tested by applying two pulses, the first one at 80\% of the threshold and the second one at 120\% of the threshold, both pulses would be separated by 3ms. For testing intracortical facilitation two pulses, at 80\% and 120\%, were used, but in this case separated by 15ms. These tests were repeated 10 times each, and performed on both hemispheres.

For testing interhemispheric inhibition the subject was asked to apply pressure with the thumb, first at maximum strength, and then maintaining it at 50\% of the maximum level. Afterwards a single, at 200\% of the motor threshold ,pulse would be applied on the same side as the target muscle, this pulse would generate a responde on the opposite side but also would cause an inhibition in the active muscle. 

%TMS processing
The signal captured by the EEG machine includes an artifact generated by the TMS pulse. An example signal can be seen in figure X. This signals are analyzed with the help of matlab scripts in other to determine the latency between the artifact and the motor evoked potential (MEP) or the inhibition; as well as the amplitude of the MEP in both cases. It is specially important to calculate the different in MEP amplitude between the baseline and intracortical inhibition or facilitation trials. The time it takes for the signal to arrive from the motor cortex to the muscle is related to the distance it has to travel, therefore it is common to correct latency values using subject height. Another parameter that is measured is the length of the silence in the inter-hemispheric inhibition signal.

MRI image acquisition was done at the San Ignacio University Hospital using a Phillips Achieva tree Tesla scanner with a eight channels head  antenna. A sequence resembling MPRAGE was captured in order to provide freesurfer the best images it can handle. Additionally a volumetric T1 image and a Flair sequence were captured to provide additional anatomical context. In addition a high quality diffusion weighted sequence was captured as one of the main goals of the study was analyzing white matter. Tables \ref{tab_mri_params} and \ref{tab_fmri_params} show the acquisition parameters used for each sequence.

Five f-MRI paradigms were used in this study: Attention, coordination, memory, grip and fear. Because each participant could only remain inside the scanner for a limited time, not all paradigms could be applied to all subjects. Two groups were created, the first one went trough grip, coordination, attention and memory; while the second one trough grip, coordination and fear. 

The grip paradigm had a block design where subjects were asked to apply pressure with thumb on the side of the index finger, and in this way activating the first dorsal interosseus muscle, the muscle targeted in the TMS test. The coordination paradigm also had a block design but this time the task was opening and closing one or both hands following the pictures presented in the screen. The attention used a block design as well, in this case the subject would be presented with seven points on the screen, and they were instructed to follow the tree red points that blink. Afterwards all points would become black and start moving around the screen. At the end the initial points would become red again and the participant would be asked if they arrived to the same final position. 
The memory paradigm was composed of two stages, both in block designs. During the first stage participants were shown couples of words and asked to memorize them. During the second stage participants were presented with a word they have seen before, and two other words. They were asked to identify from the two options, which word was seen before with together with the first word.

¿POR QUE SE HICIERON ESTOS PARADIGMAS?

The fear conditioning paradigm \autocite{FRANCOISES} was event related and divided in two stages. In the first stage participants were randomly presented with two woman faces. Additionally half of the time one of the faces was shown, it was accompanied by a loud scream.  During the second stage  both faces were shown again randomly, but this time there would not be any scream. After the presentation of each face at both stages participants would have to respond using a qualitative scale how anxious they were feeling.
\smallskip

% Data analysis
Image data was pre-processed as described in section \ref{sec_preproc}. Anatomical images went trough a VBM analysis using SPM comparing the two groups from the randomized study, using age and gender as control variables. Additionally \emph{Eigenvariants} for each subject in each region of interest were extracted and added to the database of variables. MPRAGE images went trough the FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline and all output statistics (volumes, cortical thickness, surface areas, and cortex curvature) were added to the database. 

At this points all of the spatial artifacts generated by freesurfer were also available in Braviz, and therefore it was easy to use python scientific libraries to perform additional analyzes. We created a script that went trough all segmented structures, and for each one calculated the main, second and third axes, as shown in figure \ref{fig_jth_descs}. The lengths of these axes were added to the database as new variables.

% JTHP descriptors

	\label{fig_jth_descs}
\end{figure}

DWI data was processed using Camino and the Free Surfer brain masks as references. Transformations between diffusion space and structural MRI space were calculated using \emph{FSL FLIRT}. From Camino we obtained FA, MD and color DTI maps, as well as full brain tractography. All of these were integrated into Braviz and made available for the experts. Additionally by using python scientific libraries and vtk we were able to combine Free Surfer data with tractography in order to isolate bundles going trough particular structures. Mean FA, mean MD, mean length and number of tracks in the bundle were extracted for each bundle of interest.  While this could be achieved without Braviz, it was certainly easier using the infrastructure provided by the software. Additionally Braviz was used to let experts define spherical regions of interests and, based no them, define additional bundles of interest. The same scalar metrics mentioned before were extracted for these bundles. 

Additionally DWI data was processed using Free Surfer's Tracula. Output statistics were exported into the database and the probability maps of the bundles were integrated into Braviz for visualization. 

Functional MRI data was pre-processed in SPM.  After that a first level analysis was performed using specific contrasts for each paradigm, followed by a second level analysis using the main groups as regressor. The results from this analysis can be seen in \autocite{PABLO_FELIPE}. The Braviz \emph{fMRI Explore} tool was particularly useful in the first level stage as it displayed contrasts in a direct and clear way. Figure \ref{fig_spm_contrast_error} shows a problem with a contrast, because the left and right conditions are not of the same length. This problem was quickly identified and corrected.

\subsection{Economics}

The Research Group in Economics from Universidad del Rosario got involved in the project in order to analyze the education and work history of the cohort. The main question for the group was finding if the kmc intervention had effects on educational and work outcomes.  For this purpose they created a questionnaire, based on validated questions from previous studies and the National Department of Statistics (DANE). This questionnaire was applied to each participant at the end of the domiciliary visit. This instrument inquired about the schools to which the participant attended, the performance in those schools, if currently the participant was studying or working, what kind of studies were they pursuing and what kind of work were they performing. Participants were reminded that the information collected was only for research purposes and that data that could identify them would never be published. The questionnaires were tabulated by a professional at the foundation and verified by the Economics group. Finally the results were merged with the other variables of the study.

Additionally participants gave their authorization to fetch the results of the last state high-school test (Saber-11) they completed. This test is applied to all students of the country when they are about to finish high-school, and it comprises sections on mathematics, language, social studies, natural sciences and English.

Analysis began by taking a broad look of the effect of the intervention on key variables, as the current age and performance in Saber-11. This was done using linear regression in the Stata software. At the next stage the analysis was performed using additional variables as controls. These variables were chosen based on economics theory and previous experience of main researchers. This stage showed some apparent contradictions in the results, which were discussed with the rest of the Kangaroo team. From this discussions ideas of possible explanations and additional variables that should be taken into effect emerged. This ideas were tested against the data with positive results. 

It must be noticed that the analysis was carried out mainly trough tables generated by Stata. Generating graphics in this software required additional steps, and therefore was done only to create the results.
